# Progressive multi-device input processing algorithms framework

## Intro

Mac touchpads, keyboards, mouse (of all kinds), and modern screens have greatly enriched the way people interact, but a significant portion of that interactions has not been handled well.

For example, the Macbook's touchpad comes with a smoothing process, where the user stops touching it and it still swipes at the same speed as the trend for a more subtle animation - however, most of the time on the web side this smoothing effect is just numerous `wheel` events and will simply, wrongly scales the page. When you've searched many blogs and github and can't find a perfect solution, that's frustrating.

## TODO

- Mobile interaction complement;
- Keyboard interaction complement;
